217
00:01:32,907 --> 00:01:33,307

218
00:01:33,607 --> 00:01:33,827
pounds

219
00:01:33,867 --> 00:01:33,927

223
00:01:34,347 --> 00:01:34,528
weeks.

224
00:01:35,668 --> 00:01:35,768
You

225
00:01:35,788 --> 00:01:35,928
could

226
00:01:35,968 --> 00:01:36,268

227
00:01:36,328 --> 00:01:36,508

228
00:01:36,648 --> 00:01:36,988
life,

229
00:01:37,028 --> 00:01:37,168
Mr.

230
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:37,668
Wonka.

00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:38,729
Change

their

234
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:40,049
lives.

235
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:41,930
Run

236
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:42,890

237
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:44,110
Every

00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:45,190
this

242
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:45,591
world

243
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:46,191
started

244
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:46,371

245
00:01:46,411 --> 00:01:46,431

246
00:01:46,451 --> 00:01:46,831

247
00:01:49,552 --> 00:01:49,712
So

248
00:01:49,752 --> 00:01:49,912
you

249
00:01:49,972 --> 00:01:50,212

252
00:01:50,552 --> 00:01:50,832
yours.

00:01:57,297 --> 00:01:57,417

00:02:05,899 --> 00:02:06,059
So

00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:12,640
An

297
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:12,900
Oompa

298
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,060

00:02:15,161 --> 00:02:15,501
memory.

306
00:02:16,401 --> 00:02:16,521
Oh,

don't

309
00:02:16,841 --> 00:02:16,941
think

310
00:02:16,961 --> 00:02:17,021
I

311
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:17,121

319
00:02:19,122 --> 00:02:19,402

320
00:02:19,442 --> 00:02:19,622

321
00:02:20,222 --> 00:02:20,322
Once

322
00:02:20,362 --> 00:02:20,482

323
00:02:20,502 --> 00:02:20,782

324
00:02:20,802 --> 00:02:20,882
we

325
00:02:20,902 --> 00:02:21,102

00:02:21,142 --> 00:02:21,342
stop.
