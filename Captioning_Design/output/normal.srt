1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,532
I've spent the past seven years traveling the world perfecting my craft.

2
00:00:05,473 --> 00:00:08,594
You see, I'm something of a magician, inventor, and chocolate maker.

3
00:00:09,055 --> 00:00:10,796
So quiet up and listen down.

5
00:00:12,837 --> 00:00:13,337
Reverse it.

6
00:00:14,998 --> 00:00:17,379
Mr. Wonka, I can see you're a man of great ingenuity.

7
00:00:17,639 --> 00:00:18,260
What are you doing?

8
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:20,461
I'm making chocolate, of course.

10
00:00:21,381 --> 00:00:23,663
Dark, white, nutty, absolutely insane.

11
00:00:24,702 --> 00:00:27,304
Many people have come here to sell chocolate.

13
00:00:32,147 --> 00:00:34,569
You can't get a shop without selling chocolate.

14
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,972
And you can't sell chocolate without a shop.

15
00:00:40,634 --> 00:00:41,574
No daydreaming.

16
00:00:41,654 --> 00:00:42,755
What are we gonna do, Willy?

18
00:00:46,057 --> 00:00:46,338
Huh?

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,000
A double huh?

20
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:50,981
Do you have a pencil and paper?

21
00:00:51,001 --> 00:00:51,521
Uh-huh.

22
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:52,282
I got an idea.

23
00:00:54,294 --> 00:00:55,895
I know things haven't been easy for you.

24
00:00:56,095 --> 00:00:56,755
They're gonna get better.

25
00:00:56,995 --> 00:00:57,596
You promise?

26
00:00:58,916 --> 00:00:59,736
I pinky promise.

27
00:00:59,897 --> 00:01:01,477
That's the most solemn vow there is.

28
00:01:01,877 --> 00:01:02,638
Where do we start?

29
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:04,799
A good chocolate chip, Mr. Brooke.

30
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:05,599
Where's this?

31
00:01:05,859 --> 00:01:07,260
It's just weird.

32
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:08,780
What's happening?

33
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,741
Who wants a chocolate that makes you fly?

34
00:01:10,761 --> 00:01:11,842
Let's find out, shall we?

35
00:01:11,962 --> 00:01:14,483
Who's for a hammer chop?

36
00:01:14,703 --> 00:01:15,884
Nothing to see here.

37
00:01:16,004 --> 00:01:18,925
Just a small group of people defining the laws of gravity.

38
00:01:21,584 --> 00:01:24,565
Ladies and gentlemen of the Gallery Gourmet!

40
00:01:27,866 --> 00:01:28,406
He's good.

41
00:01:28,766 --> 00:01:31,607
Too good.

42
00:01:32,147 --> 00:01:34,528
Pretty sure I've gained about 150 pounds in the last two weeks.

43
00:01:35,668 --> 00:01:37,668
You could change her life, Mr. Wonka.

44
00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:40,049
Change all their lives.

45
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:42,890
Run away!

46
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,831
Every good thing in this world started with a dream.

47
00:01:49,552 --> 00:01:50,832
So you hold on to yours.

48
00:01:55,497 --> 00:02:01,378
Mark my words, this is going to be the greatest chocolate shop the world has ever seen.

49
00:02:05,899 --> 00:02:08,439
So you're the funny little man who's been following me.

50
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:12,420
I will have you know that I am a perfectly respectable size for an Oompa Loompa.

51
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,320
An Oompa what now?

52
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,501
Allow me to refresh your memory.

53
00:02:16,401 --> 00:02:17,581
Oh, I don't think I want to hear that.

54
00:02:17,701 --> 00:02:18,041
Too late.

55
00:02:18,701 --> 00:02:19,622
I've started dancing now.

56
00:02:20,222 --> 00:02:21,342
Once we've started, we can't stop.
