1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,625
- I've spent
the past seven years

2
00:00:01,708 --> 00:00:03,333
traveling the world,
perfecting my craft.

3
00:00:05,375 --> 00:00:07,208
You see, I'm something
of a magician,

4
00:00:07,292 --> 00:00:08,917
inventor and chocolate maker.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,875
So quiet up and listen down.

6
00:00:10,958 --> 00:00:13,167
Nope. Scratch that, reverse it.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,458
- Mr. Wonka, I can see you're
a man of great ingenuity.

8
00:00:17,542 --> 00:00:18,917
- What are you doing?

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,208
- I'm making chocolate,
of course.

10
00:00:20,292 --> 00:00:22,792
How do you like it?
Dark? White? Nutty?

11
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:24,208
Absolutely insane?

12
00:00:24,292 --> 00:00:27,083
- Many people have come here
to sell chocolate.

13
00:00:27,167 --> 00:00:28,958
They've all been crushed...

14
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:32,125
by The Chocolate Cartel.

15
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:34,458
You can't get a shop
without selling chocolate,

16
00:00:34,542 --> 00:00:36,750
and you can't sell chocolate

17
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:38,750
without a shop.

18
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:42,917
-No daydreaming.
-What are we gonna do, Willy?

19
00:00:44,667 --> 00:00:45,875
-Huh.

20
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:47,750
-Huh?

21
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:48,875
-Huh.

22
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:49,792
-A double-huh.

23
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:51,417
-Do you have a pencil and paper?
-Uh-huh.

24
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,958
-I got an idea.

25
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:55,792
I know things haven't
been easy for you.

26
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:57,625
They're gonna get better.
-You promise?

27
00:00:58,625 --> 00:00:59,833
-I pinkie promise.

28
00:00:59,917 --> 00:01:01,500
That's the most solemn vow
there is.

29
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:03,292
-Where do we start?

30
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:04,958
-A good chocolate
should be simple.

31
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:07,333
-Whereas this, it's just...
-Weird.

32
00:01:07,417 --> 00:01:08,875
-CROWD: Whoa!
-What's happening?

33
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:10,750
Who wants a chocolate
that makes you fly?

34
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:11,792
- Well, let's find out,
shall we?

35
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:13,667
Who's for Hoverchoc?

36
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,917
-[giggles]
-Nothin' to see here.

37
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:17,375
Just a small group of people

38
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:19,292
defyin' the laws of gravity.

39
00:01:21,417 --> 00:01:22,958
-Ladies and gentlemen

40
00:01:23,042 --> 00:01:25,250
of The Galeries Gourmet,

41
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:27,750
my name is Willy Wonka.

42
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:29,625
-He's good..
-Too good.

43
00:01:31,667 --> 00:01:32,792
-[grunts]
-Pretty sure I've gained

44
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:34,917
about 150 pounds
in the last two weeks.

45
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:37,417
-You could change
her life, Mr. Wonka,

46
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:40,333
change all their lives.

47
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,625
-Run away!

48
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,667
-Every good thing in this world

49
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,417
started with a dream.

50
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:51,833
So you hold on to yours.

51
00:01:51,917 --> 00:01:53,667
-[whispers]
Here we go, Mama.

52
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:57,167
Mark my words,

53
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,917
this is gonna be
the greatest chocolate shop...

54
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:01,583
...the world has ever seen.

55
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,208
So you're the funny little man

56
00:02:07,292 --> 00:02:08,250
who's been following me.

57
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:09,250
-I will have you know

58
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:11,333
that I am a perfectly
respectable size...

59
00:02:11,417 --> 00:02:12,250
for an Oompa Loompa.

60
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:13,417
-An Oompa-what-now?

61
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,250
-Allow me to refresh
your memory.

62
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:16,250
[ethereal music]

63
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:17,542
-Oh, I don't think
I wanna hear that.

64
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:18,583
-Too late.

65
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:19,833
I've started dancing now.

66
00:02:19,917 --> 00:02:21,750
Once we've started,
we can't stop.
